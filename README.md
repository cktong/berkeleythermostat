#Berkeley Thermostat

##What is this?
UC Berkeley Thermostat Project is an ongoing research project with Professor David Levine that aims to create software 
to interface with the CT-30 Radio Thermostat. The program retrieves data on indoor and outdoor temperatures and 
optimizes the home HVAC system in order to minimize electricity costs while optimizing comfort.
